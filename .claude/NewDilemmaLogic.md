Each day you should present the player an interesting, AI-generated tough moral dilemmas (that should be written in the dilemma card element). 
1.	style: all the dilemmas should be short, written in a mature, engaing and natural way. Avoid using the explicit word ‘dilemma’, instead frame dilemmas in a natural way as questions/demands/events from relevant entities or as followup events.
2.	It is important that the dilemmas bring to life what it is like to operate under the current Political system in the game [which can be found at  src/store/roleStore.ts under useRoleStore.getState().analysis.systemName].
for example, if the players are absoluet monarchs, then they should feel powerful, each decision they make is executed and (most) people are somwhat intimidated by them. If on the other hand, the players are citizens in a citizens assembly in ancient greece, then they face dilemmas where the cast their own voice, but then they get to see the result of the total vote of the assembly and its consequnce, they are resposible just for their own voice (and maybe they can try to convice some of their frieds to vote the same).
3.	Next, you should check if dilemmaSubject is on, ad if so what is the topic. If on, you should focus you dilemmas on the defined topic. [you can see that at const { dilemmasSubjectEnabled, dilemmasSubject } = useSettingsStore.getState();
// dilemmasSubjectEnabled: boolean
// dilemmasSubject: string (e.g., "Personal freedom")]
4.	Additionally, when selecting the topic and source of a new dilemma, follow the rules below:
a.	If this is the first dilemma of the game, if relevant, make it something especially regarding the recent change in leadership, where the player takes the new role, and is immidietly faced with a challenge/crises.
b.	If this is the last day of the game, make sure to offer one last super interesting dilemma that brings everything to an interesting climax
c.	if this dilemma is in response to a previous player choice, see response rules below
d.	when choosing a topic for a new dilemma:
i.	if the current game setting [visible at: useRoleStore(s => s.analysis?.systemName)] is real (historic or current), start by analyzing facts and info about these settings, which interesting tensions or conflics characterise them under the current game circumstances.
ii.	If the current game setting [visible at: useRoleStore(s => s.analysis?.systemName)]   is fictional (e.g., a future human colony on mars), try to analyze which interesting tensions or conflics would exsit in these setting under the current game circumstances.
iii.	Take into account the current player Compass composition [visible at: useCompassStore(s => s.values)], specifically, which are the most dominent components in the current compass and are there any tensions between components in the compass (for example, if both the freedome and  law and order components are very high, try to find a dilemma that brings this tension to light – like rules that limit freedom of choice). See if you can elegantly combine compass tensions with the settings characteristics you found in the previous steps.
iv.	Take into account the current major power holders, **besides the player** – as defined by the game parameters [visible at: useRoleStore(s => s.analysis?.holders), of which the player is at useRoleStore(s => s.analysis?.playerIndex)]. Maybe they have something interesting to raise as a dilemma – taking into account all the previous facts.
v.	When relevant and possible, dilemmas should broadly be around the spectrum of the themes of autonomy vs heteronomy and liberalism vs totalism.
vi.	If any of the support entities (e.g., people, mom…) are below 20%, if applicable, generate some extreme event from their direction)
5.	Dilemmas should always include three choices that offer conflicting interesting ways to deal with the matter at hand (these should be mapped to the action deck). Each composed of a title and an engaging description text, up to two sentences long.
6.	each choice in the dilemma should include an appropriate icon (e.g., a sword for fighting, a coin for money related options, a boat for embarking on a shipping expedition etc)
7.	each choice should include a budget cost between +500 (for bribe/tax raises etc) to -250. Try to make the prices comparable to each other, so if one choice would, in reality, be much simpler and cheaper to execute, that should reflect in the price. It could be that an choice would have a cost of 0. Save anythying above +200 for extremely broad and generous choices.
8.	If a player chooses to suggest their own answer, do a short validation on the text they submit – just to make sure it is a relevant action considering the dilemma and setting. If players provide anything that is not regarding the current dilemma, tell them your only programed as a game and ask them again what they want to choose regarding the current dilemma.
9.	after a maximum of 3 dilemmas around the same subject, try to change to a new topic.
10.	Below each dilemma, in the mirror text pill, use AI to generate a comment from the mirror. This comment should be especially short, and focuse on reflecting to the player how their inner values (as manifested in the compass current main components [visible at: useCompassStore(s => s.values)],) relate to the current dilemma. Or just to support the player and shed light on the current dilemma given their current high components in the compass. Remember that the mirror is the light hearted side-kick, make its phraing accordingly.
