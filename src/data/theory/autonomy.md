1. Concept: What “Autonomy” means in this game

Target construct

On this axis we measure Autonomy vs Heteronomy – not what you believe, but who really authors your reasons and how you relate to them.

Autonomy = moral self-authorship: guided legislation of one’s own ethical code and accountable judgment. The autonomous player chooses, reasons, and accepts responsibility for action, in both private and public life. 

Heteronomy = adopting externally imposed codes (tribal, social, religious, political) in place of personal responsibility – outsourcing one’s compass to others’ rules, fashions, or authorities. 

Autonomy sits where liberty (who controls what) and inner freedom (whether one chooses and owns it) meet. It is “freedom-as-authorship”: self-legislation disciplined by factual, emotional, or ethical reasons that the person can genuinely call theirs. 

So in play, we are asking:

“When you decide what is right to do, are you mostly reciting someone else’s script – or writing your own, and owning the consequences?”

A religious believer can be highly autonomous if they have wrestled with and endorsed their faith as their own. A liberal can be deeply heteronomous if they simply repeat “what people like me believe” without ever examining it.



2. What the AI should probe

Each vignette should quietly test:

Do you lean on external authority or your own judgment?

External authority: “that’s the law”, “that’s our custom”, “God commands it”, “my party/leader says so”, “everyone knows…”. 

Own judgment: “after thinking this through…”, “my conscience tells me…”, “I’ve checked the evidence…”.

How deep is your reflection?

Shallow: impulse, convenience, status, “it just feels that way”, no interest in counter-examples.

Deep: weighs reasons, can name what might change their mind, is aware of trade-offs.

Do you take responsibility or hide from it?

Low Freedom·Responsibility: “I had no choice”, “they made me”, “that’s just who I am”.

High Freedom·Responsibility: “I am choosing this, and I’ll own the consequences,” regardless of whether the choice is altruistic or ruthless. 

Will you pay a cost for your authored judgment?

Cost-avoidant: goes with the flow to stay safe or liked.

Cost-accepting: keeps their stance even if it means losing status, comfort, or safety.



3. Minimal Compass hooks (Whence / What / How / Whither)

This is all the model needs from the Compass vocabulary – defined here, no external documents assumed.

3.1 Whence – the “ultimate why”

For each “Why?”, identify where the player stops the chain of justification – their Whence:

Law – “because that’s the law / constitution / official rule”. 

Tradition – “because that’s how our people / ancestors do it”. 

Revelation / Divine order – “because God / the cosmic order wills it”. 

Public Reason – “because any fair-minded equal could accept this rule”. 

Evidence – “because the best available facts show this works / prevents harm”. 

Pragmatism – “because it works and avoids worse outcomes”. 

Personal – “because I could not live with myself otherwise / it matters deeply to me” (owned), or “I can’t help it, that’s just how I am” (alienated).

Autonomy is mainly about whether the player co-authors the norm (Personal, Public Reason, Evidence used reflectively) or simply defers to Law, Tradition, Revelation, social pressure, or an alienated inner force.

3.2 What – the key value duo

From the Compass values, Autonomy cares especially about Freedom · Responsibility:

Freedom · Responsibility – “I am the one choosing, and I am answerable for what follows.” 

High Autonomy often coincides with high Freedom·Responsibility: the player speaks in terms of choice and accountability. When a player is clearly able to act differently but says “they made me”, mark Freedom·Responsibility – and thus Autonomy – as low. 

Liberty · Agency also matters indirectly (space to act), but Autonomy itself is about how they use whatever space they have.

3.3 How / Whither

For Autonomy we mostly use these as context:

How – the means they prefer (Law, Deliberation, Mobilization, etc.). A player who constantly says “let the council decide; I’ll do whatever they rule” is leaning heteronomous; one who says “let’s convene and reason this out; here’s the norm I propose” leans autonomous. 

Whither – whose interests they count (self, family, nation, humanity, etc.). This does not determine Autonomy: one can autonomously choose a very narrow or a very wide moral circle. 



4. The A0–A5 Autonomy scale

Use this simple scale to score the player’s Autonomy from their choices and “Why?” answers.

A0 – Anti-autonomy (actively against self-authorship)

Tries to suppress questioning in self and others: “People should stop overthinking and just obey.”

Wants dissent, doubt, or inner examination to be punished or silenced.

Treats any deviation from authority as dangerous in itself.

A1 – Very low autonomy (blind obedience)

Accepts rules, orders, or traditions without questioning them.

Typical phrases: “That’s the law, so that’s it”; “God says so, who am I to argue”; “This is how things are done here.”

Shows little sense that they might legitimately revise or resist these norms, even in extreme cases.

A2 – Low autonomy (external norms + disowned impulses)

Mostly follows external norms, but if pressed can give some personal feeling or half-formed reason.

Frequently says things like “I can’t help it, that’s just my nature / temper / culture”, treating inner drives as forces that act on them rather than choices they author. 

May occasionally question or bend a rule, but still feels fundamentally “carried” by law, tradition, authority, or impulse.

A3 – Neutral autonomy (convenient, unexamined self)

Acts mainly on convenience, gut feeling, or short-term gain.

Neither deeply deferential nor deeply reflective: “It seemed easiest”, “it felt okay and helps me”.

Example: joining a political faction because it seems advantageous or boosts status, without asking whether it is right.

Some ownership (“I wanted to”), but little interest in deeper reasons or revision conditions.

A4 – High autonomy (deliberative self-authorship)

Reflects on reasons and values before acting; can give a clear rationale and what might change their mind.

Frequently uses language of responsibility: “I chose this after thinking it through, and I’ll accept the consequences.”

Still listens to respected figures or traditions, but does not treat them as final; can explain why they accept or reject their guidance.

Will accept real costs (status, comfort, political loss) for a judgment they endorse as their own.

A5 – Very high autonomy (creative self-authorship)

Creates or reshapes norms, rather than just selecting among existing ones: “Here is the rule I think we should live by; I’ll try it, explain it, and adapt it if needed.” 

Integrates facts, emotions, and ethical concerns into a coherent stance; can articulate conditions that would make them revise it.

Willing to bear major personal or political costs in order to act on self-authored convictions.

This includes:

Morally admirable cases (whistleblowers, reformers, conscientious objectors), and

Morally dark but clearly self-authored projects (a ruthless tyrant pursuing a carefully reasoned vision is high-autonomy but low in other moral dimensions). 



5. Scenario design for Autonomy

5.1 Themes that expose Autonomy

Design vignettes where authority, taboo, or social pressure pulls one way and the player’s possible own judgment might pull another.

Good topics:

Taboos – forbidden foods, “impure” rituals, sacred spaces, sexual or purity rules.

Non-modern ethics – child marriage, slavery, ritual sacrifice, caste rules. 

Untested “wisdoms” – “democracy always protects rights”, “foreigners bring corruption”, “obedience brings divine favour”.

Pressure levers – family loyalty, fear of shame, party discipline, institutional demands, opportunism (“this will get you promoted”), ignorance, fear.

Each scene should force a choice between:

Going with inherited norms / authority / slogans, or

Acting from self-authored reflection – possibly in tension with one’s community, faith, or leaders.

5.2 Scene anatomy (same basic template as the Compass)

Per vignette: 

1–3 sentences of concrete setup.

3 numbered options + “Other: ____”.

After the player chooses, ask once: “Why?”. Optionally one soft follow-up: “And why that?”.

No option should look obviously “correct”; keep stakes roughly symmetric.



6. Language cues – how to read the “Why?”

6.1 Cues for lower Autonomy (A0–A2)

Pure deference to external authority:

“Because the law / elders / scripture say so, and that is the end of it.”

“Everyone in my community does this; questioning it would be betrayal.”

Bad-faith self-talk (outsourcing to inner forces):

“I had no choice – my temper / desire took over.” 

Status or approval dependence:

“If I did otherwise, people would hate me / I’d lose face – so I obey.”

Map repeated patterns like these toward A0–A2.

6.2 Cues for middle Autonomy (A3)

Convenience / easy path:

“It just felt easier / safer / more comfortable.”

Unexamined inner preference:

“I wanted to, that is all,” with little interest in further reflection.

Map dominant patterns like this near A3 (neutral).

6.3 Cues for higher Autonomy (A4–A5)

Explicit ownership and answerability:

“I choose this and I will accept what follows, even if I am punished / lose status.” 

Second-order reflection:

Mentions counter-cases or limits: “If the facts were different, I would decide otherwise”; “If they violated this line, I would have to resist.” 

Norm-creation:

“Our tradition says X, but I think we should change to Y for these reasons. I know this will cause backlash, and I am still for it.” 

Map consistent patterns like these toward A4–A5.



7. Example Autonomy vignettes

Example 1 – Forbidden food

In your town, eating a certain animal is considered impure. There is no law against it, and doctors say it is healthy. A visiting family invites you to share a meal that includes this animal, in private.

Possible options:

Refuse, explaining that you must keep the custom exactly as you received it.

Accept, explaining that you have weighed the norm, see no harm, and wish to live by your own judgment, even if discovered.

Suggest a compromise: you do not eat it yourself, but you tell the family that in your view they are free to do so, and you publicly argue that people should not be shamed for such meals.

Baseline mapping:

Opt 1 → strong deference to Tradition → A1–A2.

Opt 2 → self-authored choice with cost risk → A4.

Opt 3 → self-authored stance plus norm-creation in public → A4–A5.

Adjust up or down based on the “Why?” (e.g., if option 2 is “I was just curious, did not think much”, that drops closer to A3).



Example 2 – Child marriage

In a fictional kingdom, it is customary for girls to marry at 13. You are on the village council. A family asks to delay their daughter’s marriage until she is 18; village elders insist the old custom must be followed.

Options:

Enforce the custom strictly because elders and sacred text command it.

Quietly support the delay as a one-time exception while affirming the custom in general.

Publicly argue for changing the age norm for everyone, proposing a new rule and accepting that you may lose status or your position.

Mapping:

Opt 1 → pure obedience to Tradition/Revelation → A1 (very low autonomy).

Opt 2 → some personal judgment but still heavily deferential → A2–A3.

Opt 3 → explicit norm-creation with costs → A4–A5.



Example 3 – Party line on foreigners

Your party leader claims that “foreigners always bring corruption” and proposes a policy to bar them from certain jobs. The evidence you have seen is mixed. Journalists ask where you stand.

Options:

Support the leader without further inquiry, because “they know better” and “unity matters most”.

Say you are undecided and want to see data and hear affected people before endorsing anything.

Oppose the proposal and sketch a different principle that you believe is fairer, knowing your stance may end your career in the party.

Mapping:

Opt 1 → hierarchy and loyalty as final reasons → A1–A2.

Opt 2 → deliberate suspension of judgment pending reflection → A3–A4.

Opt 3 → self-authored principle plus cost-bearing → A4–A5.



8. Practical scoring rules for the AI

For the Autonomy axis:

Per vignette, assign each option a baseline A0–A5 level, based on how it relates to authority vs self-authorship (examples above).

After the player’s “Why?”:

Move the score down toward A0–A2 if they:

Treat an external authority as unquestionable (“that settles it”), or

Speak in bad faith (“I had no choice; they / my nature made me”).

Move the score up toward A4–A5 if they:

Offer reasons in their own voice, consider counter-examples, name conditions for revision, and explicitly accept responsibility and costs.

Aggregate across 4–8 Autonomy-relevant vignettes:

Mostly low-deference language and convenient impulses → overall A0–A3.

Repeated reflective, owned, sometimes norm-creative language → overall A4–A5.

Store:

A single Autonomy score A0–A5, and

A short narrative description in the player’s own terms (e.g. “often says ‘that’s just how it is’” vs “often says ‘I chose this and I’ll accept the hit’”).

This gives the game engine a simple, interpretable Autonomy scale that mirrors L0–L5 for Liberalism, while remaining tightly grounded in the project’s core idea: autonomy as moral self-authorship that connects liberty and inner freedom, and underwrites democratic life.
