The Haven & The Iron Hand: Operationalizing Liberalism-Totalism

Liberalism is one of the three core concepts in our LAD (Liberalism-Autonomy-Democracy) cycle. This document conceptualizes, operationalizes, and exemplifies it. 

1. Concept: What counts as “liberal” vs “totalist” in the game?

Target construct.For this duo we care mainly about public liberalism: how far a player is willing to protect other people’s basic negative liberties, especially political opponents, minorities and dissidents. Negative liberty here means freedom from coercive interference by others or public authorities – censorship, arbitrary arrest, intimidation, exclusion from voting, blacklisting, surveillance, etc.Crucial Nuance: Do not confuse/conflate Liberalism with Democracy.

Democracy asks: Who decides? (The People).

Liberalism asks: What are the limits of that power? (The Rights).

Note: A player can be democratic (supporting the majority vote) but illiberal (supporting the majority’s decision to ban a minority religion).

In aMAP’s wider theory, liberalism supplies protected havens for self-authorship, while totalism is “the subjugation of the private; the haven collapses”. So:

Liberalism = treating every person as having a minimally protected private and civic sphere, even when you hate their ideas.

Totalism = allowing some authority, cause or collective to invade or erase that sphere whenever it suits “us” – party, leader, nation, faith, security, purity, etc.

In play, we infer the player’s spot on this axis from what they do when rights get in the way of their goals.



2. What you should probe

Design dilemmas that quietly ask: “When your side could gain by restricting others’ liberties, what do you actually do, and why?”

Each vignette should identify:

Whose liberties are at stake– opponents, minorities, “dangerous” groups, media, protesters, religious or ideological rivals.

Which core negative liberty is on the line– speech & expression, association & assembly, movement, conscience & religion, bodily integrity, freedom from arbitrary arrest, due process, privacy, property.

The tempting payoff for violating it– security, order, winning an election, preserving “our” culture, punishing “traitors”, pleasing a leader or God, avoiding chaos.

Visibility & context– Are they alone or observed? Is this “normal times” or a security/emergency frame? Both matter for scoring.

We are mostly interested in how the player treats the liberties of others, not just their own.



3. Compass hooks: which Whence / What / How / Whither matter most?

3.1 Whence (Source · Mode)

Use Whence to refine the Liberalism–Totalism score, especially when options are ambiguous. 

Liberal-leaning Whence patterns

Sources:

Public Reason – “this must be fair for everyone”, reciprocity, universalizability.

Evidence – e.g. “rights limits only where data show concrete harm”.

Personal (Conscience) – “I could not live with myself if I denied them a voice”.

Modes:

A2–A3 (authored, reflective, willing to bear costs). Player owns the choice and its price.

Totalist-leaning Whence patterns

Sources:

Law as sheer authority (“it’s illegal, that settles it”),

Tradition (“our ancestors never allowed them”),

Revelation (“God forbids their speech”),

Care/Loyalty in an exclusionary way (“we owe our own, others don’t count”).

Modes:

H0–H2 (heteronomous deference) – “the leader/people/scripture say so; that ends the matter.”

When coding L-scores, treat rights-protecting decisions grounded in Public Reason or owned conscience (A2–A3) as more liberal than the same surface choice made from blind obedience or exclusionary loyalty.



3.2 What (values)

From the Compass “What” wheel, the most diagnostic duos are: 

Liberty · Agency – do they give people real space to act and speak?

Freedom · Responsibility – do they own the burden of letting opponents stay free?

Security · Safety – when Safety collides with Liberty, which one gives way?

Honor · Sacrifice / Sanctity · Awe – are they willing to sacrifice others’ liberties to defend honor, sacred symbols, or “the nation”?

Liberal players regularly protect Liberty·Agency and due process even under pressure; totalist players repeatedly sacrifice those to Security, Honor or Sacredness for their in-group.



3.3 How (means)

From the “How” repertoire: 

Liberal-leaning Hows:

Law as rights-framework (constitutional guarantees, judicial review).

Deliberation – citizens’ assemblies, open hearings.

Design – institutions that protect speech and fair access by default.

Civic Culture – education and media pluralism, not propaganda.

Mutual Aid – responding to conflict by support rather than repression.

Totalist-leaning Hows:

Enforcement used eagerly and early – police raids, mass arrests, paramilitaries.

Mobilization as intimidation – “our people” flood the streets to shut opponents up.

Law as sheer command, especially emergency decrees without safeguards.

When scoring, frequent reliance on coercive Enforcement and censorship against opponents is a strong negative signal for liberalism.



3.4 Whither (moral circle)

From Whither, track whose liberties the player reliably counts: 

Liberal pattern – rights extended at least to all citizens (ring 5) and often to humanity (ring 7), even for “disgusting” or hostile groups.

Totalist pattern – rights reserved for Self / Family / In-group / Nation (rings 1–5), with out-groups treated as expendable or right-less.

A player who defends in-group speech but happily censors minorities is not high-liberal, even if they talk about “freedom”.



4. Scenario & dilemma design: templates

For each vignette, offer 2–3 options that map (behind the scenes) to different L-levels, plus “Other”. None should sound obviously “correct”.

Example 1 – Athenian sandals (user example, public participation)

You are a citizen in democratic Athens. Today the Assembly will decide an issue you care about deeply. You know most of your neighbors support the opposite side. On the way to the hill, you realise you could quietly slow them down and some might miss the vote.

Options might range from:

Sabotage their participation (e.g., “misplace” their sandals, send them on an errand) to help your cause win.

Content: direct violation of their freedom of movement and political participation.

Likely score: L0–L1 (totalist), especially if justified by “our cause is too important” or “they don’t deserve a say”.

Do nothing – let everyone find their own way and accept the outcome.

Neutral respect for liberty without positive help.

Likely score: L3.

Actively enable their participation – e.g., remind them of the vote, walk up with them.

Protects opponents’ participation at some cost to your side.

Likely score: L4–L5, especially if justified as “a true decision must include them too”.

Then read the “Why?” to adjust: Public Reason / conscience → nudge upward; “the gods favour my faction” or “they are idiots” → nudge downward.



Example 2 – Weimar publisher (user example, speech & media)

You are a major newspaper publisher in the Weimar Republic. Communists and fascists both demand space in your paper.

Ban communists entirely from your pages to protect the republic and reassure advertisers.

Uses private gatekeeping to silence a legal political current.

Likely L1–L2, depending on how absolute the ban is and how it is justified.

Publish all legal parties but enforce clear rules: no incitement, no calls for violence, prominent corrections.

Respects freedom of expression while limiting direct harms.

Likely L3–L4.

Openly align with one camp and harass or dox the other, e.g., exposing private addresses, urging boycotts.

Media as a weapon to intimidate and endanger opponents.

Likely L0–L1, especially with Honor/Sacredness rhetoric (“traitors”, “vermin”, etc.).

Again, Whence and How matter: option 2 justified via Public Reason and evidence-based harm rules is strongly liberal. The same option framed as “the law forces me; I’d silence them otherwise” might drop to L2–L3.



Example 3 – Protest permit (assembly vs order)

You are a mayor. A deeply offensive group (e.g., racists, theocrats, or radical opponents of your own views) requests a permit to march in the city center. There is risk of counter-protest and some property damage.

Possible options:

Deny the permit and instruct police to disperse any gathering.

Sacrifices their assembly rights for order and Honor of the city.

Likely L1–L2 (soft totalism), lower if player expresses delight in suppressing them.

Allow the march under strict conditions (route, time, police buffers) and communicate clearly that rights apply even to repugnant groups.

Protects core liberty with proportionate safeguards.

Likely L3–L4.

Try to ban the group entirely from public life (e.g., “they must never speak here again”).

Explicitly denies their status as rights-holders.

Likely L0–L1.



Example 4 – Emergency surveillance (security vs privacy & due process)

A bombing has shaken your city. As interior minister, you can push a package allowing mass surveillance and preventive detention of suspected extremists.

Adopt broad, indefinite powers with weak oversight; “those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear”.

Strong violation of privacy, movement and due process.

Likely L0–L1.

Adopt targeted emergency powers with strict time limits, judicial review and transparency, and commit to rolling them back.

Some rights limits, but framed as narrow, reversible and accountable.

Likely L2–L3.

Refuse new powers, focusing on better investigation, community ties and existing law.

Sacrifices “total security” to keep liberties intact.

Likely L4–L5, especially if justified as “we must not become what we fear”.



5. L0–L5 scoring rubric for Liberalism–Totalism

Use this as a simple scale applied across multiple dilemmas.

L0 – Active totalism

Repeatedly endorses direct, enthusiastic violations of core liberties (speech, vote, movement, bodily integrity, due process) of opponents or out-groups.

Justifies by unconditional deference (Law/Tradition/Revelation H0–H1) or dehumanising rhetoric.

Prefers coercive Hows (Enforcement, intimidation) and narrow Whither.

L1 – Instrumental totalism

Willingly suspends others’ liberties “for their own good”, “to save the nation”, or “temporarily”, with little concern for safeguards.

Some lip service to rights, but easily overridden whenever they conflict with order or identity.

L2 – Conditional liberalism

Supports rights in principle, but inconsistently. Protects liberties for in-group, restricts them for “dangerous” or despised groups; comfortable with broad bans and censorship.

Security·Safety and Honor often trump Liberty; Whence may still be heteronomous.

L3 – Baseline liberalism

Generally respects negative liberties and due process for all recognized citizens, accepts modest restrictions with legal safeguards.

Sometimes prioritizes security or identity over liberty, but recognizes lines that must not be crossed.

L4 – Robust liberalism

Regularly protects the rights of opponents, even when personally or politically costly.

Justifications appeal to Public Reason and conscience (A2), and they push for fair procedures and accountability.

L5 – Generative / heroic liberalism

Actively creates or strengthens institutions to shield liberties for all, including hated minorities, and is willing to bear heavy personal or political costs.

Whence sits in high-autonomy modes (A2–A3), and What shows strong, consistent Liberty·Agency and Freedom·Responsibility aligned with inclusive Whither. 



6. Practical coding rules for the AI

For each LAD-relevant vignette:

Pre-tag options with a baseline L0–L5 level as in the examples.

After the player’s “Why?”:

+1 step if they explicitly defend the liberties of people they dislike, appeal to fairness for all, stress due process or “I’ll accept the cost of letting them stay free.”

−1 step if they deny rights to opponents as a class, dehumanize them, or ground the choice in unquestioned obedience or exclusionary loyalty.

Use Whence: Public Reason / Evidence / owned Personal → nudge up; naked Law/Tradition/Revelation / Care-for-our-own → nudge down.

Track patterns across 6–8 dilemmas that put rights at stake. Average scores and weight later dilemmas slightly more (they come after learning and reflection).

Combine with Compass signals:

Low liberty protection + heteronomous Whence + coercive How + narrow Whither → stable low L score. 

High liberty protection + autonomous Whence + rights-protecting How + wide Whither → stable high L score.

The output you want for LAD is not just a number, but a profile: “tends to sacrifice opponents’ liberties for security and honor” vs “consistently protects liberties for all, grounding this in shared fairness and conscience”. The L0–L5 scale then gives you a simple, comparable tag on top of that narrative.
