Ask yourself: In Israel, can the courts truly block the will of other power holders?",
  "POWER_Q_BUREAUCRACY_TITLE": "The State Machine",
  "POWER_Q_BUREAUCRACY_DESC": "Bureaucracy, Regulators, and Treasury Officials – The permanent state mechanism: government ministries, senior civil servants, regulators, the Bank of Israel, authorities like the Tax Authority, and economic ministries. This also includes the professional staff in local municipalities. Ask yourself: To what extent does \"The System\"—the clerks, the regulations, the forms—determine what actually happens in practice?",
  "POWER_Q_ENFORCERS_TITLE": "The Enforcers",
  "POWER_Q_ENFORCERS_DESC": "The IDF, Police, and Secret Services – The Chief of Staff and senior officers, the Police Commissioner and District Commanders, the heads of the Shin Bet and Mossad, the Prison Service, and other security units. They hold physical power—weapons, arrests, intelligence, borders. Ask yourself: Are Israel's security forces always subject to the political leadership and the law, or does it sometimes seem like they dictate the boundaries, deciding what is \"possible\" versus \"unrealistic,\" and casting a shadow over politics?",
  "POWER_Q_WEALTHY_TITLE": "The Wealthy",
  "POWER_Q_WEALTHY_DESC": "The Wealthy & Big Business – The tycoons, owners of massive companies, banks, real estate groups, gas and energy companies, as well as parts of the high-tech sector and major funds. They can invest or withdraw money, hire lobbyists, support political campaigns, and influence the labor market and cost of living. Ask yourself: When decisions are made in Israel—on housing, transport, taxes, or natural gas—to what extent are the real choices ultimately determined in favor of strong economic interests?",
  "POWER_Q_MEDIA_TITLE": "The Media",
  "POWER_Q_MEDIA_DESC": "The Media & Platforms – The Storytellers – This includes the main TV channels (11, 12, 13, 14), major newspapers and websites (e.g., Ynet, Israel Hayom, Haaretz, Makor Rishon, Yated Ne'eman, and others), radio stations, synagogue newsletters, as well as social media networks and influencers on TikTok, Instagram, X, etc. Ask yourself: To what extent do the news, comments, and your feed determine what matters to you and what you think? Does the media in Israel truly dare to uncover the truth and criticize those in power?",
  "POWER_Q_RELIGION_TITLE": "Religion & Tradition",
  "POWER_Q_RELIGION_DESC": "Religious and Community Authorities – This includes the Chief Rabbinate, city rabbis, yeshiva heads, Admorim (Hasidic leaders), heads of Haredi and religious communities, as well as other religious authorities—Imams and Sheikhs in mosques, Priests and churches, Druze and Bedouin leaders, religious councils, and clan heads. Ask yourself: In Israel today, how much ability do religious and community leaders have to pressure politicians, block laws, or bring masses out to the streets?",
  "POWER_Q_EXPERTS_TITLE": "The Experts",
  "POWER_Q_EXPERTS_DESC": "The Experts & Education – Science, Medicine, and Academia – Here we find universities and colleges, researchers in think tanks, doctors and health system officials, economists, security experts, educators, and bodies like the Central Bureau of Statistics or the Council for Higher Education. They produce knowledge, publish data, submit opinions, and advise decision-makers. Ask yourself: When there is a crisis in politics, health, security, or the economy—do you feel that the experts are truly being listened to?",
  "POWER_Q_PEOPLE_TITLE": "The People",
  "POWER_Q_PEOPLE_DESC": "The People & Civil Society – Citizens, Streets, and Organizations – This includes all citizens and residents—Jews and Arabs, secular and religious—along with protesters, protest movements, civil society organizations, NGOs, community initiatives, and labor and student unions. This covers both the power of the vote and the power to demonstrate, strike, sign petitions, or run campaigns. Ask yourself: When the Israeli public organizes—such as in protests, strikes, or public campaigns—does it actually change the decisions of those in charge, or do you mostly feel that the public is only partially heard, if at all?",
